WHAT IS A STACK?
A LIFO data structure!

Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.
Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!
They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implement
Insert and remove are both O(1)
